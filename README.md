# Thesis_Code
This repository holds all code used for my thesis about "Adaptieve tensor factorisaties om versneld tijdreeksen te clusteren". 
The implementation is a generalization of the Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) algorithm for matrices by M. Pede. This code van be found on his Github page [1]
and is described in the paper "Snel clusteren van tijdreeksen via lage-rang benaderingen" [2]. The data used throughout the thesis is from Decroos et al., [3].
